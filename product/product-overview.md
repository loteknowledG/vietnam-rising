# Vietnam Rising

## Description
A high-energy, neo-brutalist design portfolio project that showcases the rapid growth of Vietnam's tech hubs. The platform demonstrates advanced UI capabilities by aggregating React developer job listings from major platforms like LinkedIn and ITViec for HCMC, Hanoi, and Da Nang.

### Problem 3: Immersive Web Experience
Uses the tallest skyscrapers of each city (Landmark 81, Landmark 72, Da Nang Downtown) as parallax backgrounds to showcase proficiency in advanced CSS, layering, and interactive visual storytelling.
