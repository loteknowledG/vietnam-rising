# Da Nang Hub Specification

## Core Concept
**"The Coastal Climb"** — A vertical journey through **Landmark Tower**, Da Nang's tallest skyscraper, where job listings emerge as you ascend from the coastal base to the summit overlooking the Han River and My Khe Beach.

## Landmark
**Landmark Tower** (Future Icon of Da Nang)
- 69 storeys, 408 meters tall
- **Expected completion**: 2028 (Sun Group's 30th anniversary)
- Located in Da Nang Downtown, set to become Central Vietnam's tallest tower
- **Design inspiration**: Five Elements (Ngũ Hành) and the flowing áo dài, transforming into a torch lit by the sun
- Panoramic views from My Khe Beach to Ba Na Hills
- Symbol of Da Nang's ambition and cultural depth

## Interaction Model
Da Nang features a **vertical ascent** similar to Hanoi, but with a distinct coastal identity:

1. **Entry Point**: Start at the **Ground Lobby** (coastal base)
2. **Scroll Direction**: Vertical scroll upward (ascending the tower)
3. **Job Reveal**: Job listings slide in as you climb, representing floors of the tower
4. **Visual Metaphor**: Each job represents a floor in Da Nang's growing tech ecosystem
5. **Summit**: Reach the 69th floor with views of the coast and city

## Color Palette
**Cyan/Teal** accents to represent:
- The coastal location and beaches (My Khe Beach)
- The Han River flowing through the city
- A fresh, modern tech hub vibe
- Distinct contrast to HCMC's lime and Hanoi's amber

## User Flow
1. **Ground Lobby**: Hero section introducing "Da Nang" with coastal skyline
2. **Tower Ascent**: 6-8 job listings representing key floors
3. **Summit Finish**: Arrival at the 69th floor with panoramic coastal views

## Navigation Items
- **HCMC** → Vertical Descent (Landmark 81, 81 floors)
- **Hanoi** → Vertical Ascent (Landmark 72, 72 floors)
- **Da Nang** → Vertical Ascent (Landmark Tower, 69 floors)

## Differentiation from Hanoi
While both Hanoi and Da Nang use vertical ascent:
- **Hanoi**: Capital city, amber/gold palette, government/enterprise focus
- **Da Nang**: Coastal tech hub, cyan/teal palette, startup/innovation focus
- **Visual**: Da Nang's tower is slightly shorter but emphasizes coastal/beach aesthetics

## Technical Notes
- Similar vertical scroll implementation to Hanoi Hub
- Job cards slide in with coastal-themed animations
- Tower visual core with cyan/teal accents
- HUD displays: City name, job count, "Landmark Tower" landmark
- Auto-scroll to bottom on first visit (start at Ground Lobby)
