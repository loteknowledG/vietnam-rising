# HCMC Hub Specification

## Overview
The flagship HCMC Hub features an immersive "descent" through Landmark 81. As users scroll from the spire, React developer job listings slide in laterally to "fit" into the building's structure as floors, creating a dynamic, construction-like reveal of the tech market.

## User Flows
- **The Descent**: User enters at the spire. Scrolling down triggers lateral "slide-in" animations where jobs snap into place as structural floors of the building.
- **Job Discovery**: User browses a chronological list (most recent first) of React developer roles.
- **Source Link-out**: User clicks "View Job" on a listing to open the original posting on LinkedIn or ITViec in a new tab.

## UI Requirements
- **Landmark 81 Skeleton**: A vertical anchor that feels like it's being "filled in" with jobs as the user scrolls.
- **Floor-Fit Slide Animation**: Jobs slide in from the side and align with the building's architecture as the user reaches that vertical depth.
- **Office Concept Design**: Cards styled for future support of interior office graphics (desks, people) to visualize the "work" within the floors.
- **Neo-Brutalist HUD**: Fixed city-specific stats and meta-data displayed in a high-contrast style.

## Configuration
- shell: true
